Feel free to contribute to this repository with pull requests! Here are some guidelines:

* Don't remove features - rewrite or change the underlying code of them.
* Try not to break anything - run the below tests
* Pointless PRs (such as changing the code style to your preference or adding a full stop) are unwanted
* No javascript :P

## Running the tests
Tests will be added soon
